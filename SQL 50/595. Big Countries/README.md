# Big Countries
We have a table World with the following structure:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |

+ The name column is the primary key for this table. Each row of this table provides information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.

## Problem Statement
 We define a country as "big" if it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

+ The task is to find the name, population, and area of the big countries. The result can be returned in any order.

## Example
Consider the following World table:

| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |

## The output should be:

| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
